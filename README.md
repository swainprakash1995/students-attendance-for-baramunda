Upon arrival at the learning center, students provide their names, triggering the display of their corresponding class information. After signing in with the current time, they select the subject they wish to study. Once a subject is chosen, they receive subject-related questions to complete. Upon exam completion, their score is shown, followed by a prompt to sign out. After signing out, a summary of the student's details, including name, class, sign-in and sign-out times, and their score, is displayed.
